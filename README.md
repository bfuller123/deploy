#Animal Parade
##A game for my son, Calvin

Animal Parade is a learning game for children that is built using React. By keeping record of which animal the child is looking for in the state area as true with the animals name, it can quickly check if the child is clicking the correct animal. Then once the animal is clicked, is sets that animal to false and the new animalToFind as true.

If the child clicks the footer it will read aloud what animal to find.
